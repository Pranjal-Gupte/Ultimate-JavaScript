# Chapter 0 - Introduction to Programming

Programming is a way to talk to computers. A language like Hindi, English, Marathi, etc. can be used to talk to a human but for computers we need straight forward instructions.

## Computer is dumb

When was the last time you ordered some cereal and got DVDs of Serial?    
Programming is the act of constructing a program, a set of precise instructions telling a computer what to do.

## What is ECMAscript?

ECMAScript is a standard on which JavaScript is based! It was created to ensure that different documents on javascript are actually talking about the same language.   
Javascript and ECMAScript can almost always be used interchangeably. JavaScript is very liberal in what it allows.

## How to execute JavaScript?

JavaScript can be executed right inside one's browser. You can open the JavaScript console and start writing JavaScript there. 
Another way to execute JavaScript is a runtime like Node.js which can be installed and used to run JavaScript code.   
Yet another way to execute JavaScript is by inserting it inside of `<script>` tag of an HTML document or you can create a JavaScript file with `.js` extension and link it using `<script src="yourfilename.js"></script>`. Make sure it add it at the end of the `<body>` tag.
